    "### Predicting Venue Likes\n",
    "We found that population density, postsecondary degree, and unemployment rates were the best predictors for venue likes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting Venue Price\n",
    "Price was difficult to predict with the available demographic data. The best we found was using average household size and unemployment rate, both of which are negatively correlated and account for only a third of the variability in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting Venue Rating\n",
    "We see that percent of working age adults accounts for half of the variability of rating and that the higher percentage, the higher the rating will be. This suggests new businesses should open in areas with large working-age populations. The highest R-squared value we found, however, was for a model looking at unemployment rate, percent living alone, percentage of pre-retirement individuals, and percentage of people living alone. The lower the unemployment rate and the percert of pre-retirees, along with a slight increase in percent of people living alone, accounts for greater ratings.\n",

    "### Predicting Demographic Information\n",
    "In testing various regression models using Foursquare data to predict demographic information, we noticed that individual features can be fairly good predictors (accounding for 30 to 50% of targets), but combining predictors achieve no significant increase in R-squared. This is likely because the three Foursquare predictors are themselves highly correlated and don't contribute much to the model when added together.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We began this project with the hope that we could find some linkages between Toronto's demographic data and Foursquare data for venues in Toronto. Although some of the results were promising, neither data sets gave an complete conclusions. We recommend that if both governments and business would like to use these results for their own predictions, that they do so carefully. The results show general trends, but cannot be used to predict exact amounts. There is still to much variability that is not explained by the predictors used here, both for predicting demographic information and Foursquare information. However, we do believe these results can be used for a quick check for new businesses to see if their other research matches with the results found in this project."
